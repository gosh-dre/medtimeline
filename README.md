# medtimeline

The MedTimeline library aims to provide a standardised process for pre-processing and generating patient journey timelines for the cardiology EHR dataset.

The following provides an overview of how to use the library to:

Configure the library based on your own data paths and computer set-up <br/>
Load patient journeys based on individual RDVs <br/>
Load pre-processed RDVs, without generating timelines <br/>
Load combined patient journeys based on procedure RDVs <br/>
Load pre-processed, individual procedure-related RDVs, without generating timelines <br/>
Load complete, full patient journeys, for all admissions, based on all RDVs. <br/>
Timelines are a useful step in large language modelling and can be used for various research purposes. <br/>
